                <p>Xiahai Town God temple, founded in 1859, is an important belief center for people in the Area of Dadaocheng. The main worship was the town god of Xiahaei, and the main god in the side temple was lady City God. The side temple was also dominated by female gods, so it also became the spiritual sustenance of local women. In the past, women in Dadaocheng used to go to the town God temple to pray for the blessing of the city God's Wife. Since then, whenever a woman wished for the happiness of her family, she would present embroidered shoes to show her gratitude. This was also the origin of the city God's Wife's shoes. Up to now, both sides have independence and equal status equally in marriage, because this offer asks a pair of lady shoes to go back, in addition to symbol the lady to bless the whole family in the home safe, also let the member in the home each other tolerance, respect, feeling harmonious and happy.</p>

                <p>The original nature of the market was to sell food and snacks, but because of its proximity to the Daidaocheng dock, Japanese traders used this place as a wholesale center for cloth imports. At that time, more than half of the cloth traders in Taiwan gathered in Daidaocheng. </p>
                <p>However, when the stores needed labor, the women of the family assisted the men, which was the most common female role in the daidaocheng businesses. This kind of double labor is women's work, which is to play the role of wife and mother in the wholesale and retail stores. On the other hand, they still have to serve as employees, but also have to take care of guests and staff meals. After the war, however, women were able to participate in or take charge of the stores, gradually reversing the traditional role of women and further changing the original relationship between the sexes.</p>

                <h5>Introduce</h5>
                <p>In 1921, Jiang Weishui founded the "Taiwan Cultural Association" in Da 'an Hospital. Under the influence of the traditional patriarchal concept of respecting men and giving priority to husbands, Women in Taiwan were oppressed and their status and status could not be treated reasonably and equally. Therefore, "Taiwan Cultural Association" also accepted women members. </p>
                <p>Jiang's ideas were advanced, and his goal was to "affirm the principle of equality between men and women, aid the feminist movement, and oppose human trafficking". In 1924, "Women's Health" was serialized in "Taiwan Minbao", which was a set of quite detailed women's health manual.

                <p>In the 1930s, the whole society was filled with the avant-garde thoughts of "freedom, democracy and equality". In 1933, the song "Spring Breeze" composed by Mr. Li Linqiu and Mr. Deng Yuxian caused a sensation all over Taiwan. The first phrase fully expressed the reserved and wild desire of the girls, and spoke the unutterable inner words for the girls, arousing the resonance of the public. Although he is a male lyricist, he can deeply copy the state of mind and suffering of women longing for love. In the conservative age of both sexes, he writes the voices of women at that time, which has become one of the characteristics of this song.</p>
                <p>Li Linqiu's creation covers all levels of society, and writes songs for many middle and low class people. His works take "three points elegant and seven points popular" as the main body, which can not only express the beauty of Taiwan Hokkien, but also take into account the acceptance of the general public.</p>

However, due to the persistence of footbinding and the shackles of traditional concepts, few girls went to school. It was not until 1918 that the number of girls in Yilan Public School reached the standard of establishing an independent school. In that time, Yilan Public School for Girls was established, which was the first school exclusively for girls in Yilan. At that time, however, the goal of education was to train women to be tailors and domestic workers. It was not until 1996 that the school was officially closed for girls and was renamed as yilan National Primary School.</p>

                <p>During the period of Japanese rule, yilan was inconvenient to travel to other places. Those who wanted to study for high school girls had to go to Taipei and Keelung, which was very inconvenient. Under the constraints of economic conditions and the preference for sons over daughters, only a small number of children of the gentry were able to achieve their wishes. In 1938, the Taipei Lanyang State High School for Women was finally established. After the war, the school was renamed Taiwan Lanyang Girls' Senior High School and is now national Lanyang Girls' Senior High School. The gate is the only remaining facility of the school, which was designated as a county historic site in 2011.</p>
