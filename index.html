                <h5>Introduce</h5>
                <p>The Xiahai City God Temple was founded in 1859 and it is an important center of faith for the people in Dadaocheng. In addition to the main worship of Xiahai City God, the main deity in the side hall is Goddess Cheng Huang, and the authority of side halls are almost female deities, so it has become the spiritual support for local women.</p>
                <p>In the past, women in Dadaocheng used to go to the Xiahai City God Temple to pray for the blessing from the Goddess Cheng Huang for harmony and happiness. Since then, whenever a woman gets her wishes, she will offer a pair of embroidered shoes for her gratitude. Nowadays, husband and wife have the equal status in marriage, therefore a pair of embroidered shoes is also a symbol of blessing for the harmonious and happy family relationship.</p>

                <p>The Yongle Fabric Market was originally a market selling food and snacks, because it was close to the Dadaocheng wharf, Japanese merchants used the area as a wholesale center for fabric imports. At that time, more than half of the fabric merchants in Taiwan gathered in Dadaocheng.</p>
                <p>The most common female dual-labor role was proprietress, being wife and mother, as well as acting an employee to serve customers and taking care of the employees' daily meals. After the world war, women were able to participate in or take charge of the store ownership, gradually reversing the traditional roles of women and further changing the original relationship between male and female.</p>

                <p>In the 1930s, full of wealthy merchants gathered in Dadaocheng, so there were many large-scale restaurants, and the Wan Li Hong Public Canteen was one of them. The canteen was renamed as the Black Beauty Restaurant and named as "All Beauty" in English. It is interesting that "All" pronounce like "black" in Taiwanese Minnan.</p>
                <p>A restaurant is a place where geidan (female performer) performs or serves with food and drink. In addition to singing, geidan had to learn Beiguan, Nanguan, Jingju (Peking Opera) and other types of drama and music, and also be able to play the lute and had training in poetry at private schools. They played music and chanted poems at banquets. At first, geidan’s performance was mainly cappella and gradually added drum accompaniment and dance.</p>

Hsieh actively involved in women's movement, establishing the Taipei Women's Association and organizing the first provincial post-war Taiwan Women's Association.

                <p>In 1921, Dr. Wei-Shui Jiang founded the Taiwan Culture Association in the Daan Hospital. Under the influence of traditional patriarchy, Taiwanese women were oppressed and not treated reasonably and equally.

                <p>Dr. Wei-Shui Jiang promoted gender equality, assisted for women’s rights, and opposed human trafficking. He published a column entitled Women's Health in the Taiwan People's Daily Newspaper In 1924. It was a set of quite detailed women's hygiene manuals that the first time Taiwan media faced to women's bodies, educated women on how to understand and take care of their own bodies, and broke the stereotype of women's bodies as dirty and shameful.</p>

                <p>In the 1930s, the avant-garde trend of freedom, democracy and equality prevailed in the society. In 1933, the song Wang Chunfeng (Looking for Spring) written by Mr. Lin-Qiu Li and composed by Mr. Yu-Xian Deng made a sensation in Taiwan. The lyrics fully expressed the girls’ wild inner desire. Although Mr. Lin-Qiu Li is a male lyricist, he can deeply imitate women's desire for love. In the era of gender conservatism, this song became the voice of women at that time.</p>
                <p>Mr. Lin-Qiu Li writes songs for people from the middle and lower classes. His songs expressed the beauty of Taiwanese Minnan and are mainly elegant and being popular with the public.</p>

In addition to ordinary high school courses, it offers courses about arts, embroidery, music, foreign language, and cooking. The school recruited Taiwanese and Japanese students.</p>
                <p>Since 2020, the school has accepted male students from the junior high school and has renamed as the Blessed Imelda’s School.</p>

                <p>During the Qing Dynasty, there were strict regulations for women to become a nun, so in order to accommodate unmarried, widowed, or disabled women, the Yilan gentry funded the vegetarian hall as a home for women of the family to cultivate their morals and to live in peace. The Qichang Hall was founded in 1825 during the time.</p>
                <p>Due to the change of regime, the Qichang Hall was renamed as the Leiyin Temple in the late Japanese colonial period. In 1953, it was renamed as the Yilan Buddhism Association, and is now called the Lan-Yang Buddhist Temple of Fo Guang Shan Monastery. Although the name has been changed again and again, and those in charge of the temple have various beliefs, the followers are still mainly women.</p>

                <h5>Introduce</h5>
                <p>During the Qing Dynasty, there were three ways to honor women by giving them a plaque, by giving them silver to build a temple, and by enshrining them in the festival filial piety shrine. </p>
                <p>The shrine in the Yilan Confucian Temple currently enshrines 27 memorial tablets. It was originally built at the east gate of Yilan City (No. 12, Xunmen, Yilan Street), next to the old Confucius Temple. During the second world war, the Confucian Temple was destroyed by bombings. Since the 1950s, the shrine has been rebuilt at the current site in witness of the times.</p>

                <p>There are nearly 20 family temples in Yilan, most of them are male dominated, except the Zhonghe Hall is tied for men and women, which is rare in the traditional society. The hall was built in 1921 by Chao-Zong Zhong, son of Ms. Chiu-Kin Ho (a widow stayed in her husband's house to marry her later husband). Ms. Ho assisted her husband and son to become the largest rice merchant in Yilan. She involved in the purchase of land and property in Jiaoxi, Toucheng, and Dongshan. She often took the lead in making deeds of trust and property rights. A hundred years ago, women did not leave their homes and had no rights in property ownership. She was the forefront of the times.</p>

After the world war, Japanese nursing staff were withdrawn and the hospital held three nursing training courses in need. The hospital is now the Xinmin Hospital of the Yang Ming University.</p>

                <p>During the Japanese colonial period, it was not easily accessible to other places from Yilan. The girls who wanted to study in senior high schools had to travel to Taipei and Keelung. Due to the economic condition and the stereotypes of giving preference to sons over daughters, only a very few girls from the families of gentry were able to fulfill their wishes. After ten years of  campaigning by the local people, the Lan-Yang Girls’ Senior High School was established in 1938. After the world war, the school was renamed as the Taiwan Provincial Lan-Yang Girls’ Senior High School, and now is the National Lan-Yang Girls' Senior High School. The gate of the school is the only founding facility of the school, and was declared a county-designated historical site in 2011.</p>

                <p class="text-center ft_gloria mb-5">In 1860, when the port of Tamsui was opened, Dadaocheng became an important distribution center for tea processing and trade, and was filled with tea (foreign) houses, Chinese herbal medicine houses, local goods shops, and cloth shops, creating a long period of prosperity in Dadaocheng, where gradually became the most important commercial area in Northern Taiwan. At that time, tea pickers, which can be called the pioneer of women's occupation, have emerged. In the 1920s, the Taiwan Governor's Office (the highest authority institution in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period) implemented the policy of abolishing foot binding and promoting women's education. That prompted women to gradually enter the workplace, and such professions as geidan (female performer), waitress, midwife, female doctor, proprietress, etc. have emerged. These female roles of the times make their lives wonderful in Dadaocheng.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center ft_gloria mb-5">Ahead to Gender Equality: Yilan Women’s Empowerment</h2>
                <p class="text-center ft_gloria">Yilan City has been the seat of the county government as well as the political, cultural, and educational center since the Qing Dynasty. Women have left their footprints in the history.</p>
                <p class="text-center ft_gloria mb-5">The Shrine to Virtue and Piety, the Qichang Hall, and the Human Rights Monument are in witness of the regulation and suppression of women at that time. The Cimin Temple and the Nanxing Temple reveal women's ability to manage religious affairs and also expose the close relationship between women and folk beliefs. The streets and alleys are where women from the lower class being prostitute to earn living fees. The girls’ elementary schools and senior high schools empowered girls. It was common to see female students and teachers, and the clinics opened by female doctors studying abroad from Japan were on the main street, and modern nursing staff appeared.</p>
